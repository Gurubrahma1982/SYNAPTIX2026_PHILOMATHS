6. Scoring System
Final Weighted Competency Score Formula:
Final Score =
(Technical Skills × 40%) +
(Projects × 25%) +
(Assessments × 20%) +
(Certifications × 10%) +
(Soft Skills × 5%)
All scores are normalized to a 0–100 scale.
Confidence score is calculated based on validation strength.
7. Fairness & Bias Prevention
• Blind evaluation (no name, gender, photo visibility)
• No college-tier bias influence

• Positive contributing factors
• Missing competencies
• Weighted contribution breakdown
• Improvement suggestions
Example:
+ Strong Python proficiency (+12)
+ High ML assessment score (+8)
- Missing SQL validation (-6)
9. Evaluator Dashboard

Fairness-Aware Ranking Module
1. Problem Addressed
•     Gender-based bias in candidate evaluation
•     College tier-based discrimination
•     Location-based inequality
•     Socioeconomic background influence on ranking decisions
2. Core Features
•     Blind Profile Evaluation: Sensitive attributes such as gender, college name, and location are
hidden during scoring.
•     Fairness Constraints in Ranking: Incorporates algorithmic constraints to prevent
disproportionate representation.
•     Bias Detection Dashboard: Visual analytics to identify potential bias patterns in rankings.
•     Demographic Parity Monitoring: Ensures equal selection rates across different demographic
groups.
•     Equal Opportunity Adjustment: Maintains similar true positive rates across groups.
•     Score Recalibration: Adjusts weighted scores to correct unintended bias.
•     Representation Tracking: Continuously monitors diversity across shortlisted candidates.
•     Fair Ranking Reordering: Reorders final ranking if imbalance is detected while maintaining
merit-based logic.
3. Technical Implementation Overview
•     Weighted competency scoring independent of demographic attributes
•     Post-processing fairness optimization algorithms
•     Statistical fairness metrics computation (Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity)
•     Automated bias flagging when thresholds exceed defined limits
•     Transparent audit logs for explainability
4. Key Benefits
----------------Page (0) Break----------------
•     Promotes equitable opportunity allocation
•     Reduces systemic and implicit bias
•     Improves trust and transparency in ranking decisions
•     Ensures compliance with ethical AI standards
•     Provides explainable and auditable decision-making

Project Requirement Mapping Module
1. Module Overview
The Project Requirement Mapping Module is a core component of the Explainable Skill-Based
Internship and Project Matching Platform. It converts unstructured project descriptions into
structured, weighted, and machine-readable competency requirements.
2. Objectives
- Enable structured skill definition. - Support weighted competency scoring. - Improve transparency
and explainability. - Reduce bias in requirement design. - Enhance fairness-aware candidate
matching.
3. Required Skills Definition
Allows project creators to define mandatory skills such as programming languages, tools,
frameworks, domain knowledge, research skills, and soft skills. Skills can be tagged as technical,
behavioral, or domain-specific.
4. Skill Weight Assignment
Each required skill is assigned a percentage weight contributing to the total match score. Total
required skill weight equals 100%. Example: Python (30%), ML (40%), Communication (15%).
5. Optional Skills Configuration
Optional skills enhance ranking but are not mandatory. They provide bonus points with a capped
contribution (e.g., maximum 15%).
----------------Page (0) Break----------------
6. Experience Level Mapping
Experience levels are defined as Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, or Expert. These levels are
mapped to numerical scoring ranges for algorithmic evaluation.
7. Domain Specification
Defines the project domain such as AI, Cybersecurity, Data Science, Web Development, etc.,
ensuring contextual alignment between candidate expertise and project needs.
8. Timeline & Availability Criteria
Includes start/end dates, weekly time commitment, and work mode (remote/on-site). Matching logic
validates candidate availability overlap and required hours.
9. Team Collaboration Requirements
Defines if the project is individual or team-based. Can include role-based requirements such as
Team Lead, Developer, Researcher, and communication skill weighting.
10. Skill Priority Settings
Skills can be categorized as Critical, High, Medium, or Low priority. Critical skills may have higher
multipliers and minimum thresholds.
11. Fairness & Bias Prevention
- Prevents over-weighting prestige factors. - Normalizes domain imbalance. - Encourages balanced
soft and technical skill inclusion. - Supports fairness-aware scoring calibration.
12. Explainability Features
----------------Page (1) Break----------------
Generates detailed score breakdown including skill contribution, optional bonus, experience match,
availability alignment, and domain compatibility.
13. System Workflow
1. Define skills and weights. 2. Set experience levels. 3. Configure domain and timeline. 4. Apply
priority multipliers. 5. Generate structured requirement blueprint. 6. Pass data to matching engine.
14. Advantages
- Eliminates vague job descriptions. - Improves ranking transparency. - Enables explainable
AI-based selection. - Reduces manual screening bias. - Promotes competency-driven opportunity
allocation.

Weighted Competency Scoring Engine
1. Overview
The Weighted Competency Scoring Engine (WCSE) is the core module of the Explainable
Skill-Based Internship and Project Matching Platform. It ranks candidates using transparent
mathematical scoring instead of keyword-based resume filtering.
2. Core Formula
Base Formula: Match Score = Σ (Skill Weight × Candidate Proficiency Score) Extended Formula:
Final Match Score = [ Σ (W_s × P_s) × D_a × E_m ] + C_b + P_v + S_c + A_f
3. Key Components
W_s = Skill Weight P_s = Candidate Proficiency D_a = Domain Alignment Factor E_m =
Experience Multiplier C_b = Certification Bonus P_v = Portfolio Validation Score S_c = Soft Skill
Compatibility A_f = Availability Factor
4. Skill Normalization
Normalized Skill Score = Candidate Score / Maximum Score Ensures fairness, prevents inflated
ratings, and enables cross-domain comparability.
5. Domain Alignment Factor
Exact Match: 1.2 Related Domain: 1.0 Cross Domain: 0.8
6. Experience Multiplier
E_m = 1 + (Years of Relevant Experience × 0.05) Maximum Cap: 1.3
7. Certification Bonus
----------------Page (0) Break----------------
Platform Verified: +5 Industry Recognized: +8 Advanced Professional: +12
8. Portfolio Validation Score
Evaluates code quality, documentation, deployment, real-world impact. Score Range: 0–15
9. Soft Skill Compatibility
Assessed via communication, teamwork, leadership, adaptability. Score Range: 0–10
10. Availability Alignment
Full Match: +10 Partial Match: +5 Low Match: +0
